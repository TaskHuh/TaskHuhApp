## list of stuff to add to the app:
- habit tracker, how does this work? is it a daily reminder/checkin thing? should it be schedulable?
- reminder adder terminal, like obsidian note creator/search bar, adds addtitional arguments as needed like in discord slash commands. users can search for arguments/attributes to add, like tags, duration, recurrence, scheduled 

> "like you create a reminder with like a title, time to be done, and you can add a crap ton of settings, like priority, push notifications, is it an alarm? does it sync across devices? what custom tags do you want to use? is it recurring? and you can add those extra params if you want but they're not required."
